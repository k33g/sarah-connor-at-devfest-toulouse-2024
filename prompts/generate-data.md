Generate a structured report in markdown format that details ten different terminator series. 
Each series should have a description, followed by a list of specific terminators belonging to that series. 
Each terminator should include the following details:

1. **name:** The scientific name of the terminator, bolded.
2. **common name:** The common name of the terminator, also bolded.
3. **description:** A brief description of the terminator, detailing its characteristics and habitat.

The document should be divided into sections for each series, with the title "series: [series Name]" followed by a description of the series. 
Include a '<!-- SPLIT -->' marker between each series section.

Here's an example structure:

# Terminator series Report

## series: [name of the series of terminator]
*Description:*
[description of the series of terminator}]

### terminators:

#### [name of the terminator]

**name:** **[name of the terminator]**  
**common name:** [common name of the terminator]  
**description:** [description of the terminator]
